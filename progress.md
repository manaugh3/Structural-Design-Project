# April 26th Meeting (Important topics have been discussed):
Questions we have:
In step 4, in question 6 and 7, what is the most effective way to write the displacement and force transformation matrices to assemble the global stiffness matrix?
As the global stiffness matrix is 16 by 16, to add the truss member matrices they would need to be 16 by 16 or each term in the each matrix needs to have a
corresponding degree of freedom (variable that allows us to add into the global stiffness matrix directly from the element matrices (4 by 4)?
